1. Write a test for XML exercise2.

2. Your test should treat exercise2 as a black-box and execute it using the
   subprocess_runner function.

std_out, std_err, return_code = subprocess_runner(cmd_list, exercise_dir=base_path)

3. Your test should verify the following:

    a. std_err is a null-string.
    b. The return_code is 0
    c. std_out contains the string "inet6" twice and then string "inet" eight times.
       Note, the two "inet6" strings are included in that count of eight "inet"
       strings.
