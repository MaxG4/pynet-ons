PyEZ basic connection and facts:

Create a PyEZ Device object from the jnpr.junos Device class. This device object
should connect to "srx2.lasthop.io".

Use getpass() to enter the device's password.

Pretty print all of the device's facts. 

Additionally, retrieve and print only the "hostname" fact.
